### Summary
The React web starter contains an opinionated set of components for modern web development, including:

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)
* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) 
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for ECMAScript 2015 (ES2015) 
* [gulp](http://gulpjs.com/)

React is a framework for creating user interfaces in modular components.



<a name="requirements"></a>
### Requirements
#### Local Development Tools Setup (optional)

- Install the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 6+ LTS version.

#### IBM Cloud development tools setup (optional)

1. Install [Docker](http://docker.io) on your machine.
    * Optional: Install [IBM Cloud Developer Tools](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-cloud-developer-tools) to build, run, and deploy using IDT
```bash
# Install needed dependencies:
idt install
# Build the docker image for your app:
idt build
# Run the app locally through docker:
idt run
# Deploy your app to IBM Cloud using Cloud Foundry:
idt deploy
# Deploy your app to IBM Cloud using Kubernetes:
idt deploy --target container
```
2. Install the [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/docs/cli/index.html)
3. Install the plugin with: `bx plugin install dev -r bluemix`


#### IBM Cloud DevOps setup (optional)

[![Create Toolchain](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/graphics/create_toolchain_button.png)](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/devops/setup/deploy/)

[IBM Cloud DevOps](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/devops) services provides toolchains as a set of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks inside Bluemix. The "Create Toolchain" button creates a DevOps toolchain and acts as a single-click deploy to IBM Cloud including provisioning all required services. 

***Note** you must publish your project to [Github](https://github.com/) for this to work.



<a name="configuration"></a>
### Configuration

The project contains IBM Cloud specific files that are used to deploy the application as part of an IBM Cloud DevOps flow. The `.bluemix` directory contains files used to define the IBM Cloud toolchain and pipeline for your application. The `manifest.yml` file specifies the name of your application in IBM Cloud, the timeout value during deployment, and which services to bind to.

Service credentials are taken from the VCAP_SERVICES environment variable if running IBM Cloud Cloud Foundry, from individual environment variables per service if running on IBM Cloud Container Service (see ./server/config/mappings.json), or from a config file if running locally, named`./server/config/localdev-config.js`.


<a name="run"></a>
### Run
#### Using IBM Cloud development CLI
The IBM Cloud development plugin makes it easy to compile and run your application if you do not have all of the tools installed on your computer yet. Your application will be compiled with Docker containers. To compile and run your app, run:

```bash
bx dev build
bx dev run
```


#### Using your local development environment

Modern web applications require a compilation step to prepare your ES2015 JavaScript or Sass stylesheets into compressed Javascript ready for a browser. Webpack is used for bundling your JavaScript sources and styles into a `bundle.js` file that your `index.html` file can import. 

***Webpack***

For development mode, use `webpack -d` to leave the sources uncompress and with the symbols intact.

For production mode, use `webpack -p` to compress and obfuscate your sources for development usage.

***Gulp***

Gulp is a task runner for JavaScript. You can run the above Webpack commands in by running:

```bash
gulp
```


##### Endpoints

Your application is running at: `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser.

- Health endpoint: `/appmetrics-dash`


##### Session Store
You may see this warning when running `bx dev run`:
```
Warning: connect.session() MemoryStore is not
designed for a production environment, as it will leak
memory, and will not scale past a single process.
```
When deploying to production, it is best practice to configure sessions to be stored in an external persistence service.

### Debug

#### Using IBM Cloud development CLI
To build and debug your app, run:
```bash
bx dev build --debug
bx dev debug
```
